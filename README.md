# sass-helpers

Sass helpers I use a lot in various projects. Just use whatever you need or import the whole repository in your Sass project.

Should work out of the box.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release here: https://github.com/JelteMX/sass-helpers/releases. Make sure you download the `helpers.zip` file, not the source.
2. Unzip the folder in your sass directory. It should include a `_helper.scss` file and a `helpers` directory.
3. Include the helper with

```sass
    @include 'helper';
```

## Troubleshooting

Bugs? Please file an issue on Github and I will have a look at it.
